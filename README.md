# animeup
This is a web-scraper which will download anime episodes (japanese sub spanish) from JKAnime.net

This will be my first Python program. This program will get each 10 minutes from JKAnime.net if the animes that I'm following were uploaded. If so, I will send a notification (email or pop-up) to me. In a future, I will try to download the anime episode automatically if detected directly from the servers. This project is under develop, any suggestion is welcomed but I need to advise you that I'm learning and executing this program could cause some errors or spam.
